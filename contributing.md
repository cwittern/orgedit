Contributing
============
Contributions are most welcome, post bug fixes, new features, anything you'd like want to see.
Note that, for example, replacing the text control with a STCWindow wouldn't be accepted (most likely), as it's accessibility is quite poor, if any. But if you hide the accessibility degrading changes under an option, i have no problems with that.
